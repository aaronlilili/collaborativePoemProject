This poem is made by Aaron Li and Nidal Kabook
I once threw some rocks
I am an underground niche artist
Writing some nichie little indie tunes
My favorite instrument is a rare unknown brand of guitar
Once upon a time, I threw some rocks at that guitar
And then I got sad that the guitar got destroyed
So guess what I did...
Keep guessing...
It has to do with rocks....
